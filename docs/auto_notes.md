## cdc_sync_2ff.sv

### Module Summary: `cdc_sync_2ff`

#### Function
The `cdc_sync_2ff` module is a synchronizer designed to safely transfer a signal (`din`) from one clock domain to another (`clock`). It utilizes a two-stage flip-flop configuration to mitigate metastability issues that can arise during clock domain crossings.

#### Inputs/Outputs Behavior
- **Inputs:**
  - `clock`: The destination clock signal used to sample the input data.
  - `arst_n`: An active-low asynchronous reset signal. When asserted (low), it resets the internal registers.
  - `din`: The data input from the source clock domain that needs to be synchronized.

- **Output:**
  - `dout`: The synchronized data output, reflecting the value of `din` after being processed through the two flip-flop stages.

#### Parameters and Special Behavior
- **Parameters:**
  - `STAGES`: This parameter defines the number of flip-flop stages used for synchronization. The minimum value is 2, which is the default.

- **Reset/Clock Behavior:**
  - The module features an asynchronous reset (`arst_n`). When the reset is activated (logic low), both internal registers (`sync_reg0` and `sync_reg1`) are set to `0`. During normal operation, on the rising edge of `clock`, `sync_reg0` captures the value of `din`, and `sync_reg1` captures the value of `sync_reg
