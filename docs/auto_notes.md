## cdc_sync_2ff.sv

### Module Summary: `cdc_sync_2ff`

#### Function
The `cdc_sync_2ff` module is designed to synchronize a single-bit data signal (`din`) from a source clock domain to a destination clock domain using a two-stage flip-flop synchronizer. This is particularly useful in avoiding metastability issues when transferring signals between different clock domains.

#### Inputs/Outputs Behavior
- **Inputs:**
  - `clock`: The clock signal for the destination clock domain. The data is sampled on the rising edge of this clock.
  - `arst_n`: An asynchronous reset signal, which is active low. When asserted (low), it resets the internal registers.
  - `din`: The data input from the source clock domain that needs to be synchronized.

- **Outputs:**
  - `dout`: The synchronized data output that reflects the value of `din` after passing through the two flip-flop stages.

#### Parameters and Reset/Clock Behavior
- **Parameters:**
  - `STAGES`: This parameter defines the number of flip-flop stages in the synchronizer. The minimum value is 2, which is the default behavior of the module.

- **Reset Behavior:**
  - The module has an asynchronous reset (`arst_n`). When `arst_n` is low, both internal registers (`sync_reg0` and `sync_reg1`) are reset to `0`. 

- **Clock Behavior:**
  - On the rising edge of `clock
