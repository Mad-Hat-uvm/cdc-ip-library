## cdc_reset_sync.sv

### cdc_reset_sync Module Documentation

#### Function and Purpose
The `cdc_reset_sync` module is designed to safely synchronize an asynchronous reset signal (active-low) into a specified clock domain. This is crucial in digital designs to ensure that resets are properly handled across different clock domains, minimizing the risk of metastability and ensuring reliable operation of the system.

#### I/O Behavior
- **Inputs:**
  - `clk`: The clock signal for the synchronization process.
  - `arst_n`: The asynchronous reset input, active-low (0 = reset asserted).
  
- **Outputs:**
  - `srst_n`: The synchronized reset output, also active-low (0 = in reset). This signal is held low for a specified number of clock cycles after the asynchronous reset is de-asserted.

#### Parameters, Clocking, Reset Details
- **Parameters:**
  - `STAGES`: An integer parameter that defines the number of synchronization stages (must be >= 2). A typical value is 2, which balances latency and metastability risk.

- **Clocking:**
  - The module operates on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.

- **Reset Details:**
  - The reset (`arst_n`) is asynchronous; it immediately drives the output `srst_n` low when asserted.
  - The de-assertion of the reset is synchronous; `srst_n` transitions to high only after `STAGES` clock cycles following the release of `arst_n`.

#### Typical Usage
The `cdc_reset_sync` module is commonly utilized in various clock domains within a System-on-Chip (SoC) design. It ensures that the reset signal is cleanly released, preventing any potential glitches or metastability issues that could arise from asynchronous reset signals. The module can be instantiated in multiple locations where synchronization of reset signals is necessary, providing a reliable mechanism for reset handling across different clock domains. 

#### Example Timing
- When `arst_n` transitions low (asserted), `srst_n` drops immediately.
- When `arst_n` transitions high (de-asserted), `srst_n` remains low for `STAGES - 1` clock cycles, and then transitions high on the next clock edge. This behavior effectively creates a programmable delay for the reset release, ensuring it is safely synchronized to the clock domain. 

This module is particularly useful in designs where multiple clock domains interact, ensuring that reset signals are properly managed to maintain system stability and reliability.

## cdc_sync_2ff.sv

# Documentation Summary for `cdc_sync_2ff` Module

## Function and Purpose
The `cdc_sync_2ff` module is designed to synchronize a single-bit data signal (`din`) from a source clock domain to a destination clock domain using a two-stage flip-flop synchronizer. This helps to mitigate metastability issues that can arise when transferring signals between asynchronous clock domains.

## I/O Behavior
- **Inputs:**
  - `clock`: The clock signal for the destination clock domain.
  - `arst_n`: An active-low asynchronous reset signal that resets the internal registers.
  - `din`: The data input signal from the source clock domain that needs to be synchronized.

- **Outputs:**
  - `dout`: The synchronized data output signal that is stable in the destination clock domain.

## Parameters, Clocking, and Reset Details
- **Parameters:**
  - `STAGES`: An integer parameter that specifies the number of flip-flop stages in the synchronizer. The minimum value is 2, which is required for proper synchronization.

- **Clocking:**
  - The module operates on the rising edge of the `clock` signal.

- **Reset:**
  - The module features an asynchronous reset (`arst_n`). When `arst_n` is low, both internal registers (`sync_reg0` and `sync_reg1`) are reset to `0`.

## Typical Usage
This module is typically used in digital designs where signals need to be safely transferred between different clock domains. It is particularly useful in systems with multiple clock domains, such as FPGAs or ASICs, where data integrity and stability are critical. The `cdc_sync_2ff` module can be instantiated in designs requiring reliable data transfer, ensuring that the output (`dout`) reflects the input (`din`) with minimal risk of metastability.

## cdc_pulse_sync.sv

### CDC Pulse Synchronizer (Handshake-based)

#### Function and Purpose
The `cdc_pulse_sync` module is designed to safely transfer a 1-cycle pulse signal from a source clock domain (`s_clk`) to a destination clock domain (`d_clk`). It ensures that the pulse is transmitted without loss or duplication, utilizing a handshake mechanism to synchronize the signals between the two clock domains.

#### I/O Behavior
- **Inputs:**
  - `s_clk`: Clock signal for the source domain.
  - `s_arst_n`: Asynchronous reset signal for the source domain (active low).
  - `s_pulse_in`: A 1-cycle pulse input from the source domain.
  - `d_clk`: Clock signal for the destination domain.
  - `d_arst_n`: Asynchronous reset signal for the destination domain (active low).
  
- **Outputs:**
  - `s_busy`: Indicates when a pulse transfer is in progress in the source domain (high when the transfer is in-flight).
  - `d_pulse_out`: A 1-cycle pulse output in the destination domain, generated when the synchronized request signal rises.

#### Parameters, Clocking, and Reset Details
- **Parameters:**
  - `STAGES`: An integer parameter that defines the number of synchronizer stages (2 or 3). This controls the depth of the flip-flop synchronizers for both the request and acknowledgment signals.

- **Clocking:**
  - The module operates on two separate clock domains: `s_clk` for the source and `d_clk` for the destination.

- **Reset:**
  - Both clock domains have an asynchronous reset (`s_arst_n` and `d_arst_n`), which is active low. The reset initializes the internal state of the module.

#### Typical Usage
This module is typically used in systems where signals need to be transferred between different clock domains, such as in digital systems with multiple clock sources. It is particularly useful in applications where a single-cycle pulse needs to be reliably communicated without the risk of glitches or missed signals. The user must ensure that the `s_pulse_in` signal is asserted only when `s_busy` is low to avoid conflicts during the transfer process. The `STAGES` parameter can be adjusted based on the timing requirements and the level of synchronization needed for the application.
