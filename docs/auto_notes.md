# cdc_reset_sync Module Documentation

## Function and Purpose
The `cdc_reset_sync` module is designed to safely synchronize an asynchronous reset signal (active-low) into a specified clock domain. It ensures that the reset signal is properly managed to minimize the risk of metastability when transitioning between different clock domains in a System-on-Chip (SoC) environment.

## I/O Behavior
- **Inputs:**
  - `clk` (logic): The clock signal for the synchronization process.
  - `arst_n` (logic): The asynchronous reset signal, active-low (0 = active reset).
  
- **Outputs:**
  - `srst_n` (logic): The synchronized reset output, also active-low (0 = in reset, 1 = released). This signal indicates when the reset has been released in the clock domain.

## Parameters, Clocking, and Reset Details
- **Parameters:**
  - `STAGES` (int): Specifies the number of synchronization stages (must be >= 2). A typical value is 2, which provides a good balance between latency and metastability risk reduction.

- **Clocking:**
  - The module operates on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.

- **Reset:**
  - The `arst_n` input is asynchronous; when it goes low, the output `srst_n` immediately drops to low.
  - The de-assertion of the reset (`arst_n` going high) is synchronous, meaning `srst_n` will remain low for `STAGES - 1` clock cycles before finally going high at the next clock edge.

## Typical Usage
The `cdc_reset_sync` module is commonly utilized in various clock domains within an SoC to ensure that resets are released cleanly and without introducing metastability issues. It is particularly useful in designs where multiple clock domains need to interact safely, allowing for a controlled reset release sequence. The module can be instantiated with a specified number of stages to tailor the synchronization process to the specific requirements of the design. 

### Example Timing Behavior
- When `arst_n` transitions from high to low, `srst_n` drops immediately (asynchronous assertion).
- When `arst_n` transitions from low to high, `srst_n` remains low for `STAGES - 1` clock cycles and then transitions to high on the next clock edge, indicating that the reset has been released. 

This module is essential for ensuring reliable operation in complex digital systems where multiple clock domains are present.

## cdc_sync_2ff.sv

### Module Summary: `cdc_sync_2ff`

#### Function and Purpose
The `cdc_sync_2ff` module is designed to synchronize a single-bit data signal (`din`) from a source clock domain to a destination clock domain using a two-stage flip-flop synchronizer. This is crucial in digital designs to mitigate metastability issues that can arise when transferring signals between different clock domains.

#### I/O Behavior
- **Inputs:**
  - `clock`: The clock signal for the destination clock domain. The module operates on the rising edge of this clock.
  - `arst_n`: An active-low asynchronous reset signal. When asserted (low), it resets the internal registers.
  - `din`: The data input signal from the source clock domain that needs to be synchronized.

- **Outputs:**
  - `dout`: The synchronized data output signal that reflects the value of `din` after passing through the two flip-flop stages.

#### Parameters, Clocking, and Reset Details
- **Parameters:**
  - `STAGES`: An integer parameter that specifies the number of flip-flop stages in the synchronizer. The minimum value is 2, which is the default and is used in this implementation.

- **Clocking:**
  - The module is sensitive to the rising edge of the `clock` input.

- **Reset:**
  - The module includes an asynchronous reset (`arst_n`). When `arst_n` is low, both internal registers (`sync_reg0` and `sync_reg1`) are reset to `0`.

#### Typical Usage
This module is typically used in designs where signals need to be transferred between different clock domains, such as in systems with multiple clock sources. It is particularly useful in applications where signal integrity and reliability are critical, such as in communication interfaces, digital signal processing, and multi-clock domain systems. The two-stage synchronizer helps to reduce the risk of metastability by allowing the signal to stabilize before being used in the destination clock domain.
