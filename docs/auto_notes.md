## cdc_sync_2ff.sv

### Module Summary: `cdc_sync_2ff`

#### Function
The `cdc_sync_2ff` module is a 2-stage clock domain crossing (CDC) synchronizer designed to safely transfer a single-bit data signal (`din`) from a source clock domain to a destination clock domain. It utilizes a dual flip-flop mechanism to mitigate metastability issues that can occur during clock domain crossings.

#### Inputs/Outputs Behavior
- **Inputs:**
  - `clock`: The clock signal for the destination clock domain. The synchronizer operates on the rising edge of this clock.
  - `arst_n`: An active-low asynchronous reset signal. When asserted low, it resets the internal registers.
  - `din`: The data input signal from the source clock domain that is to be synchronized.

- **Outputs:**
  - `dout`: The synchronized data output signal that reflects the value of `din` after being processed through the two flip-flop stages.

#### Parameters and Special Behavior
- **Parameters:**
  - `STAGES`: This parameter defines the number of flip-flop stages used in the synchronizer. The minimum value is set to 2, which is essential for effective metastability mitigation.

- **Reset Behavior:**
  - The module features an asynchronous reset (`arst_n`). When `arst_n` is low, both internal registers (`sync_reg0` and `sync_reg1`) are reset to `0`. This allows for immediate clearing of the output
