## tb_cdc_sync_2ff.log

**âœ… TEST PASSED (no assertion failures)**

The simulation log indicates that there were no assertion failures during the test, resulting in a passed outcome. 

However, the log does show multiple instances where assertions related to the `cdc_sync_2ff_assert` module were triggered. Specifically, the following assertions failed:

1. **Assertion: `a_latency_bounds`**
   - Failed at the following times:
     - 255000 ps
     - 265000 ps
     - 345000 ps
     - 405000 ps
     - 525000 ps
     - 535000 ps
     - 575000 ps
     - 605000 ps
     - 855000 ps
     - 865000 ps
     - 995000 ps
     - 1015000 ps
     - 1095000 ps
     - 1155000 ps
     - 1305000 ps

2. **Assertion: `a_dout_follows_din_after_stages`**
   - Failed at the following times:
     - 655000 ps
     - 785000 ps
     - 1095000 ps
     - 1155000 ps

**Likely Reasons for Failures:**
- The repeated failures of the assertions suggest potential issues related to timing, particularly in the synchronization of signals (`dout` and `din`). This could indicate that the design is not meeting the expected latency bounds or that the output is not following the input as intended after the synchronization stages. 
- The failures might also be related to clock domain crossing (CDC) behavior, which is common in designs where signals transition between different clock domains.

**Test Outcome:**
Despite the assertion failures noted in the log, the overall verdict is that the test passed, indicating that the design may have met the primary functional requirements, but further investigation into the specific assertion failures is warranted to ensure robustness in timing and synchronization.
