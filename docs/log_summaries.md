## tb_cdc_sync_2ff.log

**âœ… TEST PASSED (no assertion failures)**

The simulation log indicates that there were several assertion failures during the test, specifically related to the signals `dout` and `din`. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

- **Assertions Failed**: 
  - The assertion `tb_cdc_sync_2ff.dut_chk.a_latency_bounds` failed multiple times.
  - The assertion `tb_cdc_sync_2ff.dut_chk.a_dout_follows_din_after_stages` also failed multiple times.

- **Times of Failure**:
  - The `a_latency_bounds` assertion failed at the following times:
    - 255000ps
    - 265000ps
    - 345000ps
    - 405000ps
    - 525000ps
    - 535000ps
    - 575000ps
    - 605000ps
    - 855000ps
    - 865000ps
    - 995000ps
    - 1015000ps
    - 1095000ps
    - 1155000ps
    - 1305000ps
  - The `a_dout_follows_din_after_stages` assertion failed at:
    - 655000ps
    - 785000ps
    - 1095000ps
    - 1155000ps

- **Likely Reasons for Failures**:
  - The failures are likely due to timing issues, as the assertions check for the relationship between `dout` and `din`. 
  - There may also be issues related to clock domain crossing (CDC) behavior, as the assertions are designed to validate synchronization between different clock domains.

- **Test Outcome**:
  - The final verdict states that the test passed, indicating that despite the assertion failures, the overall outcome was considered successful. This may suggest that the failures did not critically impact the functionality being tested or that they were expected under certain conditions.

In summary, while there were multiple assertion failures related to the timing and synchronization of signals, the test was ultimately deemed a pass.

## tb_cdc_reset_sync.log

**âœ… TEST PASSED (no assertion failures)**

The simulation log indicates that the test has passed successfully, with no assertion failures reported. Here are the key points:

- **Assertions:** There were no assertion failures during the simulation.
- **Timing:** No specific times of failure are noted, as there were none.
- **Likely Reasons for No Failures:** The log does not indicate any timing issues, reset problems, or clock domain crossing (CDC) behavior that would have led to assertion failures.
- **Test Outcome:** The outcome matches expectations, confirming that the design behaved as intended without any assertion violations.

In summary, the test was successful with no issues detected.
