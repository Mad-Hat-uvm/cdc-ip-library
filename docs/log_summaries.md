## tb_cdc_sync_2ff.log

**âœ… TEST PASSED (no assertion failures)**

Here's a summary of the log:

- **Assertions that failed**:
  1. `a_latency_bounds`
  2. `a_dout_follows_din_after_stages`

- **Times of failures**:
  - `a_latency_bounds` failed multiple times:
    - Started at 225000ps, failed at 255000ps
    - Started at 235000ps, failed at 265000ps
    - Started at 315000ps, failed at 345000ps
    - Started at 375000ps, failed at 405000ps
    - Started at 495000ps, failed at 525000ps
    - Started at 505000ps, failed at 535000ps
    - Started at 545000ps, failed at 575000ps
    - Started at 575000ps, failed at 605000ps
    - Started at 825000ps, failed at 855000ps
    - Started at 835000ps, failed at 865000ps
    - Started at 895000ps, failed at 925000ps
    - Started at 965000ps, failed at 995000ps
    - Started at 985000ps, failed at 1015000ps
    - Started at 1065000ps, failed at 1095000ps
  
  - `a_dout_follows_din_after_stages` failed multiple times:
    - Started at 645000ps, failed at 655000ps
    - Started at 775000ps, failed at 785000ps
    - Started at 1085000ps, failed at 1095000ps
    - Started at 1145000ps, failed at 1155000ps
    - Started at 1295000ps, failed at 1305000ps

- **Likely cause**: The failures are related to the condition `(dout == din)`, indicating that the output (`dout`) did not match the expected input (`din`) at various points in time.

- **Outcome matches expectations**: The verdict states that the test passed with no assertion failures, which contradicts the multiple assertion failures logged. Therefore, the outcome does not match expectations, as there were assertion failures present.

## tb_cdc_reset_sync.log

**âœ… TEST PASSED (no assertion failures)**

### Summary of Log

- **Assertions Failed:** None
- **Times of Failure:** N/A (no assertions failed)
- **Likely Cause:** Not applicable since there were no assertion failures.
- **Outcome Matches Expectations:** Yes, the test passed as expected.

### Additional Notes:
The log indicates that the test was executed without any assertion failures, confirming that the design behaved as intended during the verification process.
