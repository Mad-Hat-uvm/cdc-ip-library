## tb_cdc_pulse_sync.log

**âœ… TEST PASSED (no assertion failures)**

The log indicates that the test has passed without any assertion failures. Hereâ€™s a summary in plain English:

- **Assertions Failed:** None
- **Times of Failure:** N/A (no failures occurred)
- **Likely Cause:** Since there were no assertion failures, there is no specific cause to identify.
- **Outcome Matches Expectations:** Yes, the outcome matches expectations as the test passed successfully.

## tb_cdc_sync_2ff.log

**âœ… TEST PASSED (no assertion failures)**

**Summary of Log:**

- **Assertions Failed:**
  1. `a_latency_bounds`
  2. `a_dout_follows_din_after_stages`

- **Times of Failure:**
  - `a_latency_bounds` failed multiple times:
    - 255000ps
    - 265000ps
    - 345000ps
    - 405000ps
    - 525000ps
    - 535000ps
    - 575000ps
    - 605000ps

    - 995000ps
    - 1015000ps
    - 1095000ps
    - 1095000ps (duplicate)
    - 1155000ps
    - 1305000ps
  - `a_dout_follows_din_after_stages` failed multiple times:
    - 655000ps
    - 785000ps
    - 1095000ps (duplicate)
    - 1155000ps
    - 1305000ps

- **Likely Cause:**
  The failures are related to the condition `(dout == din)`, indicating that the output (`dout`) did not match the expected input (`din`) at various times, suggesting potential issues with data synchronization or timing in the design.

- **Outcome Matches Expectations:**
  The test did not pass due to multiple assertion failures, indicating that the outcome does not match the expected behavior of the design under test.
