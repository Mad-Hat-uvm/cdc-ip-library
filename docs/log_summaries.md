## tb_cdc_sync_2ff.log

The simulation log shows the process of running a simulation test, which includes parsing various files related to a design. The test failed because the simulation was unable to complete the parsing of some included files. One possible cause of the failure could be that there were errors or inconsistencies in the included files, which disrupted the parsing process. Another possible cause could be an issue with the file paths or the permissions to access the files.
