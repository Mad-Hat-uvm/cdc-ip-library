## tb_cdc_sync_2ff.log

**âœ… TEST PASSED (no assertion failures)**

The simulation log indicates that there were multiple assertion failures during the test, specifically related to the signals `dout` and `din`. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

- **Assertions Failed**: 
  - The assertion `tb_cdc_sync_2ff.dut_chk.a_latency_bounds` failed multiple times, indicating that the output (`dout`) did not match the input (`din`) as expected.
  - The assertion `tb_cdc_sync_2ff.dut_chk.a_dout_follows_din_after_stages` also failed on several occasions.

- **Times of Failure**:
  - The first assertion failure for `a_latency_bounds` occurred at **255000ps** and continued to fail at **265000ps**, **345000ps**, **405000ps**, **525000ps**, **535000ps**, **575000ps**, **605000ps**, **855000ps**, **865000ps**, **995000ps**, and **1015000ps**.
  - The assertion for `a_dout_follows_din_after_stages` failed at **655000ps**, **785000ps**, **1095000ps**, and **1155000ps**.

- **Likely Reasons for Failures**:
  - The failures could be attributed to timing issues, where the output does not follow the input as expected within the specified latency bounds. This could also suggest potential problems with clock domain crossing (CDC) behavior, where signals may not be synchronized correctly between different clock domains.

- **Test Outcome**:
  - The verdict states that the test passed, which contradicts the assertion failures observed in the log. This discrepancy suggests that while the overall test may have completed without a critical failure, the specific assertions related to signal integrity and timing did not meet the expected conditions.

In summary, while the test was marked as passed, there were significant assertion failures indicating potential issues with signal timing and synchronization that need to be addressed.
